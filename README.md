### Smart Templates with Keyboard Shortcuts ⚡

The addon comes with **3 preset keyboard shortcuts** that let you instantly fill the OpenEvidence search box with card content in different formats. All shortcuts work while focused on the OpenEvidence search box.

**Preset 1: Standard Explain** - `Ctrl+Shift+S` (or `Cmd+Shift+S` on Mac)
- **Front side**: Sends your front with a polite prompt
  ```
  Can you explain this to me:

  [Your front]
  ```
- **Back side**: Sends both front and back
  ```
  Can you explain this to me:

  Question:
  [Your front]

  Answer:
  [Your back]
  ```

**Preset 2: Front/Back** - `Ctrl+Shift+Q` (or `Cmd+Shift+Q` on Mac)
- Sends only the front of your card on both sides
- Perfect for when you only want to search the front

**Preset 3: Back Only** - `Ctrl+Shift+A` (or `Cmd+Shift+A` on Mac)
- Front side: Sends nothing (empty)
- Back side: Sends only the back of your card
- Useful when you want to research just the back content

**Customization:**
Click the **Settings** button (gear icon) in the panel's title bar to:
- Edit existing keyboard shortcuts
- Modify templates for each preset
- Create your own custom templates with `{front}` and `{back}` placeholders
